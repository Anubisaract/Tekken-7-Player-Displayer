# Tekken-7-Player-Displayer
> See your opponents name before accepting the match and more...

Displays your opponents name, the character they last used against you and a comment that you can write about them.
It will display them both in-game and in the console.

## Commands
* ALT+W  puts the game in windowed mode (so you don't have to worry about crashing the game by alt-tabbing)
* ALT+F  puts the game in full-screen mode
* ALT+O  opens the list of all the players you played against
* ALT+C  opens the comment window where you can write a comment after playing against an opponent

## Installation
Simply download the ready-made [Tekken-7-Player-Displayer.exe](https://github.com/ParadiseAigo/Tekken-7-Player-Displayer/raw/master/Tekken-7-Player-Displayer.exe) or you can build it yourself by loading the .sln file in Visual Studio.

## Usage
Run the executable before or after opening Tekken 7, but not during a match and sometimes not while you are in the waiting room.
To be sure the program is loaded correctly your name should be displayed in the terminal like in the picture:

## Issues
* The in-game display sometimes doesn't update fast enough and it ends up not displaying correct information. My recommendation is to always search in windowed mode and take your feedback from the terminal and switch back to full-screen before the match.
* There is a 1 out of 5 chance or so that the program is unable to get the name of the opponent. You can just decline those match requests.
* Your game language has to be in English, if it isn't the in-game display will not work, but the console will still display the correct information.
* Sometimes some steam names can cause the program to behave in untended ways. (rare)
